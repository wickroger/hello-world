# hello-world
Oh damn, I'm actually doing this!

My name is Chad Roger, and I'm from Nowhere, Kentucky.  I like video games, The X Files, coffee, pocky, and cats.  Nowhere, Kentucky isn't a real place, but if I told you where I was from, you wouldn't recognize the name, so who cares?  Anyway, this is a repository for my story (SLF) files for NANOWRIMO.
